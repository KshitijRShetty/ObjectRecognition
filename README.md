# ObjectRecognition
This project performs real-time object detection using the MobileNet SSD architecture with a pre-trained Caffe model. It identifies and classifies various common objects in images or live video streams with fast inference speed and decent accuracy, making it ideal for lightweight applications.

Tech Stack:
Python

OpenCV

MobileNet SSD

Caffe deep learning framework

üéØ Features
Detects multiple object classes (e.g., person, car, bottle, etc.)

Real-time detection on webcam feed or video files

Bounding box visualization with class labels and confidence scores

Lightweight and efficient model for edge devices
